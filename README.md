A semi-casual and optimistic sans-serif typeface, designed specifically for use in non-profit organizations, educational institutions, environmental campaigns and learning applications.

The font's design is mono-linear with rounded ends. The font is a result of the requirement where one needs a semi casual font (while not being too comic) â€“ to be able to convey a serious message but in a friendly and comfortable way. Such a requirement is often seen in design works related to education, non-profit, food blogs, environmental campaigns and children collaterals, to list some.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at `https://yourname.github.io/your-font-repository-name`.
